          Porrada is a web application created to support Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
          (BJJ) athletes - from white belts to black belts - by offering a
          personalized digital training partner. With features like technique
          tracking, training logs, instructional libraries, and community-based
          feedback, Porrada aims to improve progression, structure learning, and
          foster a strong sense of community among practitioners.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            While BJJ academies offer rich, hands-on instruction, many
            practitioners struggle with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Retaining techniques post-class</li>
            <li>Tracking personal progress over time</li>
            <li>Setting and achieving training goals</li>
            <li>Finding tailored guidance for their level or style</li>
            <li>
              Connecting with other trainees to share insights or ask for help
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Existing solutions (YouTube videos, spreadsheets, notebooks, scattered
            forums) were fragmented, inconsistent, and lacked personalization.
          </p>
          <p>
            By streamlining training management, Porrada seeks to empower BJJ
            practitioners to train more deliberately, track their evolution, and
            ultimately enhance their performance on the mat.
          </p>
          <h2>Goal</h2>
          <p>Design a centralized, intuitive, and engaging platform that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Helps BJJ practitioners capture and review techniques</li>
            <li>Tracks training frequency, goals, and milestones</li>
            <li>Enables structured reflection on rolling (sparring) sessions</li>
            <li>Connects users for peer feedback and community growth</li>
            <li>Adapts to a userâ€™s belt rank and training focus</li>
          </ul>
